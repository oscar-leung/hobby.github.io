Hobby Web Page Goals
The hobby page should do the following:

Introduce yourself and your hobby.
Describe why you enjoy doing this hobby.
Instructs a visitor on how to start your hobby, specifically for someone that has never done your hobby before.
Links to online resources or videos where a visitor can visit to further develop their skills in your hobby.
Display example images of the hobby that you have taken yourself.
Display generic images or images from the Internet related to your hobby.

Creating your Hobby Part 2
Create a folder structure that will become your root web directory. Review the Reading Material and examples to create a proper root web directory. Create your HTML file for your hobby web page.

Using either basic Divs, Flexbox, or Grids, create a simple layout for your Hobby web page. Break up different areas by purpose. Have a section for your text content, images, lists, and any other parts you want to include. Use colors as expected from the Color Theory day. Use custom fonts with Google Fonts for Step E. Remember the basic rules with font and color usage. Review the Reading Material to make sure of proper usage of these topics.

Create your HTML file and start copying and pasting your paragraphs. Use p, h1, h2, h3, a, and img HTML tags as you see fit, but please make sure the use of the HTML element is proper (e.g. do not use h2 just to make the text bigger, h2 are generally for sub-sections of h1). Please note you are not limited to just these HTML elements.

At the end of the web page, make a list that includes hyperlinks to resources, references, and image credits. If you already used your hyperlinks inside of your paragraphs, please put a copy of those hyperlinks in this list as well. Consider this list like an Appendix of a textbook.
